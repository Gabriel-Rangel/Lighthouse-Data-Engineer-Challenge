    Exports a summary of the number of teams in each competition to a CSV file.

    This function connects to a SQLite database, executes a SQL query to retrieve
    the number of teams in each competition, and writes the results to a CSV file

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Connects to the SQLite database located at 'db/football_data.sqlite'.
    2. Executes a SQL query to retrieve the number of teams in each competition.
    3. Writes the query results to 'output/summary.csv'.
    4. Closes the database connection.
